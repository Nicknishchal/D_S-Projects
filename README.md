## Overview

This project focuses on predicting taxi fares using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create an accurate and efficient model that estimates the fare for a given taxi ride based on various features like pickup and dropoff locations, distance, time, and other relevant factors.

### Features

- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

- **Multiple Algorithms**: Experimented with various regression algorithms to identify the best-performing model.

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Provides insights into the data and model performance using plots and graphs.

- **Deployment Ready**: Model can be deployed as an API or web application.

### Dataset

The dataset includes historical taxi trip data with the following features:

- Pickup and dropoff timestamps

- Pickup and dropoff latitude/longitude

- Passenger count

- Trip distance

- Fare amount (target variable)

### Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python

- **Libraries**: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
